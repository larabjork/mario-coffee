THESE were the links to my week 1 version that would go to separate pages - trying to convert to buttons instead


<%= link_to "Newest Coffee Offerings", recents_path("three_most_recent") %>

<ul>
  <li><%= link_to "Coffees with the Most Reviews", most_rev_path("most_reviews") %></li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li><%= link_to "Check Out Our Rwandan Coffees", local_path("localness") %></li>
</ul>







CUT FROM REVIEW FORM -

<%= f.label "You can call me:" %>
<%= f.text_field :author %>
